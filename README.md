# Tool-Room-Tracker
Google sheets based work log for the Tool Room that tracks tool work completed and backup backlog information.
Work is generated by machine operators.
Toolmakers select work from a que of open work (Que should be prioritized by most needed work first).
Once work to the tool is completed toolmaker will identify what work has been done to: 1. what tool, component, station 2. What action was taken in the replacement and or repair of the tool. 
Needs to have a means of quickly changing the type of work ie.. Backup or Down Job.
Needs to have a graphical means of data visualization and possibly a dashboard with the daily drivers and machine downtime from a toolroom perspective.
Needs to auto log toolmaker off tool work at the end of shift to avoid errors in time reporting also, a means to change shift time to accomodate overtime schedules.
Needs a user friendly GUI for Machine operators and Toolmakers with Dropdown and or Autocomplete lists for all or most of the data entered (to avoid long and protracted Data "Scrubbing" time.
Need to be able to export data to a google sheet for analysis by individuals so it will need to be a part of the GUI and be exportable by date range and shift.
